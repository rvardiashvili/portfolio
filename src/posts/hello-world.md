# Hello World

Welcome to my new portfolio! I decided to build this site from scratch using **React** and **Vite**. 

## Why React?

React gives me the flexibility to create reusable components, like the "Liquid Cards" you see on the main page. Combined with **Tailwind CSS**, styling becomes incredibly fast and consistent.

## The Tech Stack

Here is a quick breakdown of the tools I used:

*   **React:** For the UI logic.
*   **Vite:** For a super fast build tool.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling.
*   **Framer Motion:** (Maybe later!) For complex animations.

Stay tuned for more updates!
