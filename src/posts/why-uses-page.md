# The /uses Page

You might have noticed a new link in my navigation: **/uses**. 

## What is it?

A "uses" page is a dedicated section of a developer's website where they list the hardware, software, and other tools they use on a daily basis. It's a concept popularized by [Wes Bos](https://uses.tech/).

## Why have one?

1.  **Transparency:** It shows others exactly what tools help you be productive.
2.  **Inspiration:** I'm always looking for new tools to improve my workflow. Seeing what other experienced engineers use is a great way to discover them.
3.  **Reference:** It serves as a personal reference. If I ever need to set up a new machine, I can just look at my own list!
